= Which Mad Mimi form-type is right for me? =
If your blog has a sidebar (like most blogs), you should definitely set up a Mad Mimi form and place it at the top of your sidebar. This is a quick & easy win.

Adding a Mad Mimi post box to the bottom of your blog posts is highly recommended. Readers are highly engaged after reading a post and will be more likely to opt in. For extra effectiveness, you could set up individual Mad Mimi forms with unique call to actions & text for each category. This will result in even more Mad Mimi subscribers.

The most effective way to grow your list is our Mad Mimi popup. This Mad Mimi form is a lot more agressive than sidebar widgets & post boxes so it should be used with care. The [premium version of this plugin](https://fatcatapps.com/optincat/upgrade/m?utm_campaign=description%2Bcta&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fmadmimi-wp%2F&utm_medium=referral) comes with some advanced settings that let you fine-tune the popup further so you can maximize conversions while not annoying your users.
